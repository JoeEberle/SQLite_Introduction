# Introduction to SQLite

This project demonstrates the basics of **SQLite** through the Jupyter Notebook `SQLite_introduction.ipynb`. **SQLite** is a lightweight, embedded **relational database management system (RDBMS)** that is widely used for smaller-scale applications, mobile apps, and embedded systems. This notebook will walk you through installing, configuring, and working with SQLite, along with example code in **Python**.

## Introduction

SQLite is a powerful yet **lightweight** database engine that doesn't require a server to operate. It stores all data in a **single disk file** and is designed to be **self-contained** and **efficient** with minimal configuration. SQLite is widely used in **mobile applications**, **embedded systems**, and **small-scale projects** due to its simplicity and reliability. In this notebook, you will learn how to use SQLite, particularly in Python, where the `sqlite3` module comes **built-in**.

## Features of SQLite

- **Lightweight and Embedded**: SQLite is small and operates without requiring a separate database server. All data is stored in a single file on disk.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Since SQLite is embedded, it requires almost no configuration to get started.
- **Widely Used**: It is popular in mobile apps, embedded systems, and small-scale projects where efficiency and simplicity are required.
- **Free and Open-Source**: SQLite is freely available under a permissive license, making it a popular choice for many software applications.
- **Self-contained and Serverless**: Unlike other RDBMS, SQLite is serverless, which simplifies its setup and use.
- **SQL Support**: Despite being lightweight, SQLite fully supports **standard SQL** for managing relational databases.

## Installation

To begin using SQLite, no installation is necessary if you're working in Python, as the **sqlite3** module is included in Python's standard library. However, if you'd like to install SQLite on your system for direct interaction, follow these steps:

1. **For Windows**:
   - Download the SQLite tools from the [SQLite Downloads page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
   - Unzip the files and add the path to your system environment variables.

2. **For Mac/Linux**:
   - SQLite is often pre-installed on macOS and Linux systems. To check:
     ```bash
     sqlite3 --version
     ```
   - If it's not installed, you can install it via Homebrew (for macOS) or APT (for Linux):
     ```bash
     brew install sqlite3   # macOS
     sudo apt-get install sqlite3   # Linux
     ```

## Usage

Once SQLite is installed or accessed via Python, you can use it by following these basic steps:

1. **Creating a Database**:
   - SQLite operates on a single file that stores your entire database. Create a new database by connecting to a new or existing file:

     
   
2. **Basic SQL Commands**:
   - You can create tables, insert data, and run queries using standard SQL commands:

3. **Closing the Database**:
   - To exit the SQLite environment:

## Python and SQLite

Python provides built-in support for SQLite using the `sqlite3` module, allowing you to easily work with SQLite databases within Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Here's an example:

### Example in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
