## SQLite Overview

**SQLite** is a lightweight, self-contained relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in applications requiring a local database. 


Unlike client-server database management systems, **SQLite** operates directly on the **user's device**, making it highly portable and easy to integrate into various platforms and programming languages. Its simplicity, efficiency, and zero-configuration setup make it an ideal choice for embedded systems, mobile apps, and small to medium-sized projects where a full-fledged database server is unnecessary or impractical. SQLite's self-contained nature eliminates the need for complex database administration, while its ACID compliance ensures data integrity and reliability. Its usage of a single disk file for storage simplifies backup and sharing, making SQLite a versatile and convenient solution for developers seeking a lightweight, yet powerful, database management system.
